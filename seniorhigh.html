      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this days where all I starting to be different person because the pandemic hit the whole world and a lot of people are affected. And as I start my new path in <b>SHS days</b>, this days was so different from the <i>JHS days</i>. It's difficult road trip for my SHS days, but <em>I  study hard to graduate</em>, even though the bond of my classmates in SHS days are different because <i>we just bond more in online</i>. It was hard journey for me because it's a <i><u>new way of learning</u></i> because of <em><b>pandemic</b></em>, and <em><b>I can be able to meet new  people, make a little bond together, make some memories with them to our journey together in our SHS Days</b></em>
