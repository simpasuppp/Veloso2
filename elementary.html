     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy Elementary days was a lot of adjustment because when I was in my 1st grade I leave in <i>Surigao del Sur</i>. Staying in Mindanao is fun and at the same time there is a <em>family problem</em>, but I didn't know about it because I was still a kid back then. When I'm in 2nd grade we moved in <b><i>Cebu city</i></b>, <em>where we starting to have a new life</em>, and then transferred school in my 3rd grade and we move to <i>Mandaue city</i>. Where I enjoy the rest of my Elementary days, playing <b><i><u>"dampa"</i></b>, <b><i>"takyan"</i></b></u>, and <b><i><u>"volleyball"</u></i></b>. Make some <i>friends</i>,and we play when the clock hit at <b>4:oo o'clock</b> in the afternoon. And when I'm in my 6th grade I start to join in volleyball team, and start to train as a player, we have training everyday at <b>6:00 o'clock</b> in the morning to,<b>7:00 AM</b>, then going back to train in the 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon to <b>6:00 PM</b> in the evening. And then we compete in <i><b>District Meet</b></i> we play against different schools and we win in all of our match, then until we compete in <i><b>Division Meet</b></i> but we lose. But I'm happy that <b>I able to experience this kind of competition in volleyball</b>.
