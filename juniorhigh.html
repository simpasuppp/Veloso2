      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In these days there are so many memories because <em>I meet new people , get to know them, and became friends with them</em>. We make memories throughout the years in Highschool, <i><b>we play, laugh, have fun, and make a lot of bonds together</b></i>. And we share our secrets to each other, and as the years past that we're near to our moving up, our bond become <em>stronger</em>. And we get to more to each other, but there are some <b>ups</b> and <b>downs</b> as we walk our the same path. Highschool days give me a <b><em>lessons, challenges, and to have fun</em></b>. And I'm so glad that I can experience <b>JS Prom</b> in my highschool days not just once but twice, and make memories together along with my <i><u>classmates, friends, teachers, and schoolmates</u></i>. Because of the memories that I made in Highschool will always in my <b>mind</b> and <b>heart</b>, and as we cross the same path with this people that I'm close with. Our bond together is the best like they said, <b><em><u>Highschool life is fun and where you can find the best moments in our school days</u></em></b>.
